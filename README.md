## 🎮 How the Game Works
You gotta **play Minecraft in class** to gain **Aura**.  
And trust me—**Aura is everything**. Stack as much of it as you can.

## ✨ Gaining (and Losing) Aura

You can gain Aura by:
- 🟩 Playing Minecraft  
- 😎 Playing **Minecraft in front of your classmates** (they respect the grind)

You **lose Aura** if:
- 😬 You play lowkey (lame behavior)

⚠️ **Warning:**  
Your teachers **do NOT understand us**.  
If they catch you playing Minecraft, they will **KILL you** 💀 (in-game, obviously).

## ⌨️ Controls

- **SPACE** — Switch between:
  - Playing Minecraft
  - “Doing school work”
- **P** — Pause the game (if you’re playing IRL)

---

## 🏆 Objective

Your goal in this **hip-ass game** is simple:

> **Get as much Aura as possible before getting caught.**

Can you do it?  
Or are you **lame =/**

## ❗ Important

**PS:**  
To start the game, press the **“Start Button”**, you big idiot.
